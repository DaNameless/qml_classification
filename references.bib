  abstract={Machine learning is a subset of Artificial intelligence. Algorithms for machine learning automatically learn from experience and improve from it without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning defines Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning. Supervised algorithms are worked on under guidance but unsupervised algorithms are worked on without guidance. Machine learning provides good accuracy in both the algorithms. This paper is describing machine learning methods, different types of supervised learning algorithms, comparison of machine learning algorithms and application of machine learning algorithms.},

abstract = {The promise of quantum computers is that certain computational tasks might be executed exponentially faster on a quantum processor than on a classical processor1. A fundamental challenge is to build a high-fidelity processor capable of running quantum algorithms in an exponentially large computational space. Here we report the use of a processor with programmable superconducting qubits2–7 to create quantum states on 53 qubits, corresponding to a computational state-space of dimension 253 (about 1016). Measurements from repeated experiments sample the resulting probability distribution, which we verify using classical simulations. Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times—our benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years. This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy8–14 for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm. Quantum supremacy is demonstrated using a programmable superconducting processor known as Sycamore, taking approximately 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times, which would take a state-of-the-art supercomputer around ten thousand years to compute.},

abstract = {We give a classical analogue to Kerenidis and Prakash’s quantum recommendation system, previously believed to be one of the strongest candidates for provably exponential speedups in quantum machine learning. Our main result is an algorithm that, given an m \texttimes{} n matrix in a data structure supporting certain ℓ2-norm sampling operations, outputs an ℓ2-norm sample from a rank-k approximation of that matrix in time O(poly(k)log(mn)), only polynomially slower than the quantum algorithm. As a consequence, Kerenidis and Prakash’s algorithm does not in fact give an exponential speedup over classical algorithms. Further, under strong input assumptions, the classical recommendation system resulting from our algorithm produces recommendations exponentially faster than previous classical systems, which run in time linear in m and n. The main insight of this work is the use of simple routines to manipulate ℓ2-norm sampling distributions, which play the role of quantum superpositions in the classical setting. This correspondence indicates a potentially fruitful framework for formally comparing quantum machine learning algorithms to classical machine learning algorithms.},

abstract = {We show how the quantum paradigm can be used to speed up unsupervised learning algorithms. More precisely, we explain how it is possible to accelerate learning algorithms by quantizing some of their subroutines. Quantization refers to the process that partially or totally converts a classical algorithm to its quantum counterpart in order to improve performance. In particular, we give quantized versions of clustering via minimum spanning tree, divisive clustering and k-medians that are faster than their classical analogues. We also describe a distributed version of k-medians that allows the participants to save on the global communication cost of the protocol compared to the classical version. Finally, we design quantum algorithms for the construction of a neighbourhood graph, outlier detection as well as smart initialization of the cluster centres. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author(s).},

@article{charqc,
abstract = {Atomic-level qubits in silicon are attractive candidates for large-scale quantum computing; however, their quantum properties and controllability are sensitive to details such as the number of donor atoms comprising a qubit and their precise location. This work combines machine learning techniques with million-atom simulations of scanning tunnelling microscopic (STM) images of dopants to formulate a theoretical framework capable of determining the number of dopants at a particular qubit location and their positions with exact lattice site precision. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained on 100,000 simulated STM images, acquiring a characterisation fidelity (number and absolute donor positions) of >98% over a set of 17,600 test images including planar and blurring noise commensurate with experimental measurements. The formalism is based on a systematic symmetry analysis and feature-detection processing of the STM images to optimise the computational efficiency. The technique is demonstrated for qubits formed by single and pairs of closely spaced donor atoms, with the potential to generalise it for larger donor clusters. The method established here will enable a high-precision post-fabrication characterisation of dopant qubits in silicon, with high-throughput potentially alleviating the requirements on the level of resources required for quantum-based characterisation, which will otherwise be a challenge in the context of large qubit arrays for universal quantum computing.},

abstract = {Emerging reinforcement learning techniques using deep neural networks have shown great promise in control optimization. They harness non-local regularities of noisy control trajectories and facilitate transfer learning between tasks. To leverage these powerful capabilities for quantum control optimization, we propose a new control framework to simultaneously optimize the speed and fidelity of quantum computation against both leakage and stochastic control errors. For a broad family of two-qubit unitary gates that are important for quantum simulation of many-electron systems, we improve the control robustness by adding control noise into training environments for reinforcement learning agents trained with trusted-region-policy-optimization. The agent control solutions demonstrate a two-order-of-magnitude reduction in average-gate-error over baseline stochastic-gradient-descent solutions and up to a one-order-of-magnitude reduction in gate time from optimal gate synthesis counterparts. These significant improvements in both fidelity and runtime are achieved by combining new physical understandings and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. Our results open a venue for wider applications in quantum simulation, quantum chemistry and quantum supremacy tests using near-term quantum devices.},

abstract = {Current methods for classifying measurement trajectories in superconducting qubit systems produce fidelities systematically lower than those predicted by experimental parameters. Here, we place current classification methods within the framework of machine learning (ML) algorithms and improve on them by investigating more sophisticated ML approaches. We find that nonlinear algorithms and clustering methods produce significantly higher assignment fidelities that help close the gap to the fidelity possible under ideal noise conditions. Clustering methods group trajectories into natural subsets within the data, which allows for the diagnosis of systematic errors. We find large clusters in the data associated with T1 processes and show these are the main source of discrepancy between our experimental and ideal fidelities. These error diagnosis techniques help provide a path forward to improve qubit measurements.},

@article{Lloyd2013,
   abstract = {Machine-learning tasks frequently involve problems of manipulating and classifying large numbers of vectors in high-dimensional spaces. Classical algorithms for solving such problems typically take time polynomial in the number of vectors and the dimension of the space. Quantum computers are good at manipulating high-dimensional vectors in large tensor product spaces. This paper provides supervised and unsupervised quantum machine learning algorithms for cluster assignment and cluster finding. Quantum machine learning can take time logarithmic in both the number of vectors and their dimension, an exponential speed-up over classical algorithms. In machine learning, information processors perform tasks of sorting, assembling, assimilating , and classifying information [1-2]. In supervised learning, the machine infers a function from a set of training examples. In unsupervised learning the machine tries to find hidden structure in unlabeled data. Recent studies and applications focus in particular on the problem of large-scale machine learning [2]-big data-where the training set and/or the number of features is large. Various results on quantum machine learning investigate the use of quantum information processors to perform machine learning tasks [3-9], including pattern matching [3], Probably Approximately Correct learning [4], feedback learning for quantum measurement [5], binary classifiers [6-7], and quantum support vector machines [8].},
